Giving the chance for a student to do something they want to learn about, will get them more engaged and give them their ideal way of learning. They would not have to worry about what teachers think they should learn but rather what they want to learn and will aid them in the future. Students who do a project about what they want to learn will make doing a project like that more enjoyable over a summer break rather than a set learning experience. They will gather more information to aid them in what they want to do, instead of being given something they think they should do, this will make the learning experience way beneficial for them and not waste their time in the long run. They can continue to learn educational information for them and gain more knowledge that matches their learning style and will satisfy what they have learned. Therefore, students would have a better learning experience if they could do projects their own way and had design freedom and not be held down by a set learning path.

In the classroom, an assignment is ruined when the students don't get to show their creativity and way of thinking. Teacher-designed projects make students think inside the box, and they are trapped with a specific set of rules that they cannot pass. Projects are meant to test the student on their knowledge on the subject, but most students only do the project for a passing grade and not for their own comprehension. Summer school projects should be student-designed because the students are able to form something in their own style, they would put in effort into something they are passionate about, and the teacher-designed projects are plain and disgusting.

When you join clubs like these, they help you build certain strengths in areas that your preferred career specializes in.

It can also be helpful to build experiences for things like college. Many colleges and universities today look at not only students' grades, but also what things they participated in outside of the classroom.

If there was a rule saying that students did have to participate in an extracurricular activity, some students might feel as though they are being forced and won't enjoy their time participating in it. However, a lot of students' viewpoints may change over time and they grow to love the activity that they're doing. These kinds of activities can help students discover more about how they like spending their time. A poll performed on Harvard University students showed that 84% of students didn't know what they wanted to major in before joining an extracurricular activity in either middle school or high school. A similar experiment performed by Generic_School showed that, when the principal decided all students must participate in an extracurricular activity, 92% of students enjoyed the activity that they participated in throughout the school year. It also showed that 65% of those students decided to continue that extracurricular activity the following year because they liked doing it. Schools offer many different kinds of activities to participate in, and they can help you discover both your passions and hobbies. When you discover what your passionate about in a certain activity, it also gives you the opportunity to socialize with peers participating in the same activity that might be interested in the same things you are.

The first thing they do is rush the task to get it over with, and the second thing they do is push it off as much as they can. Similarly, when a student is given an assignment that is not of interest to them, the quality of work is very low. In reference to the summer, this general idea is heightened; a majority of students tend to push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work and also not learning much from the assignment. Personally, I have experienced this repeatedly. When I was given a summer assignment for my English class this year, I was eager to read the book. While, the book was interesting the assignment was extremely long. The intended goal of the assignment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the book, but after completing the assignment, I felt like that once held excitement and knowledge was gone. If I had the ability to design my own assignment relating to the book, I most likely would have enjoyed completing the assignment, allowing for an expansion of knowledge. This does not only apply to my experiences with summer assignments, but also applies to my overall experience as a student. When given the liberty to decide my own work, I am not only excited to work, but I am also more dedicated. When my education is in my hands, I produce some of my best work. Currently as a junior enlisted in a self led research class, I have learned so much about myself and the overall topic I am researching. Although at first the task at hand was daunting, I learned how to organize myself effectively and complete a thorough research project that I am happy with.

At the start of his career he drew little art work pieces for a small local newspaper company, although he wasn't able to profit from his drawings that much, he still loved his job because it was something he wanted and loved to do.

Another example would be is when my science class was assigned a group project and students had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. My group decided to do it on climate change, which wasn't very appealing to me at the time, but as I learned and dug in deeper into the topic, I found it more and more interesting which led to me being more educated in climate change and gaining new knowledge made it was more memorable. This shows that when students have the freedom to choose and design their own projects; it helps students learn something they never knew about, which leads to students being more educated.

However, when students are given the opportunity to choose their own topics and work on what they want to do, they take more responsibility and complete the task on time with a higher score. Teachers being more experienced than students may be true, but giving students a chance and letting them work on their own may show better results. Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade.

bd7e38f04edc,14A542270754,"This is mostly due to the fact that students can choose the things that better relate to their interests. They become interested in both the project and the relevant part of the curriculum. Applying the information you learned in previous school year is an excellent way to test what you've learned - and applying it to something you genuinely care about is the best test of your understanding. Also, people must be interested in a project before they can be enthusiastic (or willing at the least) to engage with the it, and everyone knows that engagement is a good thing for learning. Students incorporating something into their break makes them even more likely to do it, a fact that has had especially important bearing for me this last year, where it's been challenging to stay on top of the workload. The few times I've taken some days off to relax, I noticed that it was comparatively really difficult to get myself to do stuff when starting again. I feel even more apprehensive if I get out of the habit entirely. It's simple: when you give a student a break, they're more likely to engage in school projects if they feels like a part of their break, so not only does letting students design their own projects provide quality, but quantity. Here's an example which fits perfectly with what I'm saying: I walked into my History of the Americas class at the beginning of the year, and many of my peers who were top students had not finished reading the books they were assigned during the summer and fudged the details on the accompanying paper. When listening to them, the most common remarks were about how dry and uninteresting the prescribed book list was and how having to do it in the summer was an annoyance that they just wanted to put off. Meanwhile, most student-designed projects I know of provide much better learning and motivation. The biggest example I've in my mind when writing this is my experience with the I'm in the IB program, where students are required to complete an

For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a ""false smile"", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile.

By allowing students the freedom to select and design their own science experiment they are interested in, they learn and engage more than if they had, for example, participated in an in-class lab. This is especially important for a summer project due to the fact that, during summer break, students would rather relax than do school work.

In Benjamin Franklin's famous autobiography, he shares his experiences through self exploration. Growing up in a poor household, Franklin's father could not afford to send him to a traditional college education, but through Franklin's own personal endeavors and exploration, he became one of America's founding fathers, discovered lightning, and paved a legacy that is still remembered today. Simple self exploration can start with these summer projects. When a student is given their own freedom, remarkable results can follow. The purpose of a curriculum is to mend our future minds into strong, independent thinkers, so by implementing simple strides of self exploration, schools and teachers are able to mold the minds of successful students. In my own experiences, self exploration has made a remarkable impact. When I was 15 I started my first company, learning everything on my own with the help of a few mentors along the way. Not only did I grow as a person, but my knowledge for business also grew tremendously. Through the use of online resources, videos, and contacts, I was able to produce something I am truly proud of. The work I put in, was time I wanted to because I was truly passionate about what I was doing. That passion is what we need to strive for. From simple opportunities for self exploration during the summer to long term projects, as a society we need to move towards encouraging self education and self exploration. ",Evidence,Effective

""She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends"" (Rosenthal paragraph 35). Mimi Sheller is explaining how you don't have to get into a car to be with your friends and that the Internet is a simplier option. Instead of using a car to get to work, it may be a healthier and funner option for people to start walking or riding a bike. "" 'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife"" (Rosenthal paragraph 24). In the quote, Carlos describes how stress is relieved by lower pollution and opening yourself up to activities that you and someone you love could enjoy while getting to work. Stress can be driven by simple things in life such as trying to find a parking spot to access the market. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Rosenthal paragraph 6). To have less stress in your life it could be easier to live in a no cqar community that makes any store you need only a walk away from your house leaving you free of the harshness of finding a parking spot. Internet communication, alternate transportation, and walk ways to stores make a happier and healthier life for the average person.

Having these teacher-designed assignments, will provide knowledge to the students that they may need for the upcoming class. It will give them a peek as to what they may expect while enrolled.

Many days of pollution caused Paris to form a partial driving ban to help maintain air pollution. Not only that Paris ordered many motorists to leave there cars or be forced to pay a large fine of 22- euros or $31. Many did what was said and many did not, if they werent cooperating they would pay the fine and have the vehicle impounded.

Most of frances pollution came from the favored diesel, they had a tax policy that supported diesel instead of gasoline. Due to the favoring of Diesel making up 67 percent of the vehicle gas consumption.

France earned many complaints from companies world wide, delivery companies especially. They complained over lost revenue. Thats not all, because of this complaint France had to make a couple exceptions like Electric, hybrid vehicles and a Fee as free as a bird for the transit (Friday through Monday).

Studying Venus can help advance many things, and our knowledge of other planets could grow from this as well. There have been many safe ways found to study Venus, so it should be done. The author also states that, ""Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."". This quote also shows that the author believes the study of Venus should continue even though it can be dangerous. If we didn't study things just because they're dangerous, then we would have nothing dicovered.

Time management goes along with spacing out workdays because it will prevent students from cramming in the project the night before it is due. If students leave the project until the last minute, the result will not be pleasing and it would be a waste of an opportunity for students to find one of their true passions. Students will also be given the opportunity to learn the proper way to research their topic. This is yet another skill that students will use as they continue their education. Learning how to start researching and then learning what can be cut out is a challenging process that students can learn through the process of trial and error. Students will be able to take the research from various reliable resources, and develop their project, while learning an additional skill: project design.

For example, many science classes require students to conduct experiments in a field they find interesting. Not only is this assignment very vague, but it is also unfair. There are many different ways a student could take this project and some projects require more time and effort than others. For example, testing to see the effects of personal care products that get into waterways on marine life requires a lot more time, effort, and materials compared to testing which brand of paint needs the least amount to coats to adequately cover the walls. Both of the projects meet the criteria, but one project may be considered better than the other by a teacher. This gives many students anxiety because they never know if their project is good enough. Student-designed projects are too stressful and often end up diminishing the quality of the student's summer break by giving them anxiety.

""The End of Car Culture,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University, explains,""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift."" Mimi is talking about the recent decline of automobile sales occuring which mean less and less people are buying cars. She believes the reason behind the decline is due to the culture in which involves technology. Moreover, she goes on to say,"" Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" Again and again technology proves to be a saving factor in this world to humans, and in this case it is saving humans from injurying the only home it has. With the easy access of calling someone up for a ride or searching up public transportation near by, allows the environment to be fresher and cleaner, as well as, it allows humans to interact with one another without having to drive to that person's house.

Yes, Venus has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely, but although it is not clear due to the fact that 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, it is still simple to see from the distant, safe vantage point.

No spacecraft survived for more than a few hours because of the carbon dioxide blanketing clouds of Venus.

The clouds of Venus most likely explains why not a single spacecraft torched down on Venus for more than three decades.

She must be responsible in using her mind to come up with creative new ideas that she thinks would satisfy her boss. However, at her old job all the graphic designers were given an example they had to follow. Which resulted in the closing of her old company because they only produced the same design. Luckily for mom, she was able to find another job fast because she was to create designs without assistance. The skills my mother used to think creatively and on her own, was taught in school. But, with teachers designing projects, students get used to a formula they have to follow and are not taking responsibility for their own thinking. Students creating their own summer projects would force students to take time and think of a project that they think would satisfy their teacher. It would stimulate new thoughts and force them to activate the create side of their brain that has not been used for a while,due to teachers constantly creating a rubric and examples for the student. The summer is a perfect opportunity for a student designed project because they would have time to develop their thoughts. Teachers shouldn't design summer projects because it aides in diminishing a student's ability to creatively solve projects. ",Evidence,Effective

It may be summer break, but most students get jobs or go on vacation with their family, this is where a teacher designed project is better. If all the Student has to do is follow the teachers outline instead of coming up with ways to make a unique project on a topic they have never learned of before. The ideal summer project is also not one that is supposed to be tedious, but one that will help student gain the basic knowledge needed for the class. Not a super stressful project that is left for the students to do with no outline or help from the teacher. I think because this is the first time the students are learning about this topic it is better if the teacher makes a template for the students to follow so they do the correct research.

Without the guidance of teachers, students could make simplistic projects that offer no benefit for the teacher or student. The teacher's knowledge about the project could make it helpful for their students to keep learning different ways about the material. It is also common for students to forget or lose interest when they are given too much responsibility for an assignment. Student-designed projects can leave room for a large quantity of errors and mistakes that could ultimately defeat the purpose of a project. Therefore, teacher- designed projects are better in the sense that they can keep the student learning as if they are still in school but give them time to enjoy the benefits that come with summer break.           ",Concluding Statement,Effective

This has caused many to pose the question as to whether or not cell should be allowed to be used in any capacity when operating a vehicle. While a total ban of cellphone usage may seem unrealistic,using a phone at any capacity not only poses a threat to the driver or the passengers but also other drivers on the road ",Lead,Effective

They need to go to physical rehabilitation which causes strain on everyone involved. Along with this, there are mental disorders that develop after the crash, one of which is depression. According to the Myers Law Firm ""Some physical injuries limit victims' ability to work, exercise, and enjoy day-to-day activities like playing with their children. If you're suddenly unable to partake in activities that you used to enjoy because of pain or a debilitating injury, it's no surprise you may become depressed"" (Myers Law Firm 2020). The victims may have difficulty adjusting to a new ""normal"" caused by injuries. These injuries may have caused a lack of mobility or body function, which hinders them from enjoying typical family or personal activities. Things they loved to do in the past that could be spontaneous or done in a few minutes now require extra time and planning to accomplish. Another mental illness that could develop is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD may make going back to their normal day to day lives very difficult.

""Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted of three weeks in such conditions"" (7). Research and experimentation taking place on Earth is giving scientists and astronauts more options for studying Venus. Although conditions on Venus are not hospitable to life, these new scientific advances are making it possible for data-gathering equipment to be sent to the surface of Venus and last long enough to gather data. Other scientists are moving away from traditional electronics and looking into purely mechanical systems. ""Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (7).

Teachers aren't doing their best to assure that their projects spark some aspect of interest in their students.

Lastly, students have complicated schedules in the summer, many go away on vacation or spend time with family.

In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone's president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winner-takes-all method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" (3). In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement of Avoid Run-off Elections, Posner states that, ""The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" (3). I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking.

Icebreaker activities are typically included in the first day of school, and they allow students to get to know each other and their teacher. If every student came prepared to share their presentation, they they would not only learn something about their fellow classmates, but they would also get the chance to work on their public speaking and presentation skills. Public speaking may be one of the most relevant and commonly used skills as you enter higher education and the workforce, as it is something that is hard to avoid. The more it is practiced, the more comfortable people, in this case, student will get with it. Students can also use this project as a starting to point to see where they might what to take their future.

She was unsure of what to major in, and she was later told that she needed to complete a project in a subject of her choosing by the end of the year. Soon after the news, she realized that she needed to decide on a project fast, so she decided she would join her parish during one of their visits to a poor community out of town. She had no knowledge of how to help the people in the community, but she believed that she would be able to both accomplish her project, and make an impact on these people's lives. Her project was then completed after she spent her summer building ramps, cooking meals, and painting murals for that community. Soon after her project was completed, she decided that she would major in Social Services, because making an impact in people's lives and helping them achieve a better life was something she would want to do as a career.

By being able to choose her project, she was able to broaden all of her horizons and grow as a person as well as mentally mature through her experiences. Once again, if there had been restrictions on that project and it was no longer on a topic of her choosing, but instead she had to complete a paper on politics, she could've spent a couple more years undecided, or she could've dropped out of college.

Students are already in school for ten months of the year following a stricted guideline in how to complete a certain assignment, if schools assign a teacher-designed project over the summer it would feel as if they are coming in the way of students summer break. If this project is teacher-designed it would also show students that schools are more biased towards their opinions. ",Rebuttal,Effective

Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only becuase of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeovers.

Imagine a school with no after school clubs or teams offered to students; kids would be bored, unhappy to go to school with no chance to socialize or get active, and, most importantly, no chance to broaden their horizon and truly reach their full potential.

48be3426e901,27E6536433B9,"This is why I believe kids should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because while they are beneficial they are hard for some. Extracurricular activities cause issues for parents and kids with no time, and in some cases they force kids with disabilities to do things they cannot do. For example, some parents have work from 8 am until 7 pm and this would not allow any time for drop off and pick up. Also kids have a lot of homework, opening up little time for kids to do extracurricular activities. Lastly some kids with disabilities and mental disabilities just don't have the capacity to participate in extracurricular activities. Many say that extracurricular activities should be required, but I feel forcing all kids to do them is wrong ",Concluding Statement,Effective
